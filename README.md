# EDS-Weighted-Interval-Rank-Sort
 A repo for sorting EDS random quant data to find composition as function of fraction solidified following M. Ganesan, D. Dye, P.D. Lee, A technique for characterizing microsegregation in multicomponent alloys and its application to single-crystal superalloy castings. Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A-Physical Metallurgy and Materials Science, 2005. 36A(8): p. 2191-2204.
 
  * Very simple to use, just select Base element (what you compare to to decide segregation directions), SEM type that you used as the data structures of the export are diferent, and run. You will be prompted to select the data file.
  * Plots wil automatically save as high resolution tifs
  * Produces a correlation plot between elements to inspect how elements segregate
  * WIRS and Rank Sort estimates of elemental compositions as a function of fraction solidified
  * Estimate of alloy density as a function of fraction solidified
